features:
  -improve color setup: in most terminals it seems we will be limited to 64
   color pairs which is really a shame because we would like at least 81
   so we can combine the 8 ansi colors and the default bg/fg color in any
   way. one way to solve this is to use a "palette" where we keep track of
   which color pairs are being used on the screen and if we are not using
   more than the color pair limit (usually 64) we can allocate the needed
   pairs. in the event that more than 64 are being used it seems reasonable
   to default to default foreground on default background.

build system:
  -switch to a build system that is better for cross platform compatibility
   (maybe autotools?)

documentation:
  -make an ascii.io screencast to demo aug features (feature aug-db)

review:
  -review plugin api, can we make the header includes simpler?
   maybe put AUG_GLOBAL_API_OBJECTS and #include "aug_api.h"
   in aug_plugin.h.
